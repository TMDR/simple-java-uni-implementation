The University has several Departments, these Departments have several Groups and these Groups have students who study there. Each student has several subjects with grades. It is required to implement a hierarchy of students, groups and departments.

Implement the following exceptions:
• Score below 0 or above 10
• No subjects for a student (there must be at least one subject)
